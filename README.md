# CSV To MD
This program helps you to convert csv files to markdown files.

## Motivation
Have you ever had a hard time of reading such a long text in the cells?
(Like Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet)  
You might have to wrap the text or double-click each cell to expand.  
It is such an overhead, and hard to read even you wrap or expand the cells.  

So, to make the data table readable(which will save your time a lot.),  
**csv-to-md** will reform the data table and put into text hierarchy.  

## How to run
- No additional pip library required
- Please install python ^3.10
- Execute main.py on Python3 runtime
- Follow the instructions
- Make sure your input csv file in the same directory as main.py

### Example
```bash
python3 main.py
```
